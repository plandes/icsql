This library provides an [Emacs SQL mode] integration to the [ciSQL] program.
In addition it provides support for multiple buffers and fast/easy buffer (for
each SQL connection) using the [buffer manage] library.

Features:

* [Emacs SQL mode] integration.
* Utilization of JVM based [ciSQL]
* Create customize connections using the Emacs customization system or start an
  instance with no connection and then create the connection once you're in
  [ciSQL].
* Provides support for multiple buffers and fast/easy buffer (for each SQL
  connection) using the [buffer manage] library.


## Obtaining

I have not put a few last touches on this before publishing
to [Melpa](https://melpa.org/).  Create
an [issue](https://github.com/plandes/icsql/issues/new) and I'll prioritize it
for anyone who wants it.


## Usage

1. Copy [icsql.el](icsql.el) to your `~/.emacs.d` directory (or whever you keep
   ad-hoc libraries).  See the [note](#obtaining) regarding making this a Melpa
   library.
2. In your `~/.emacs` file add: `(require 'icsql)`
3. Optionally customize SQL connection(s) with `M-x customize-variable RET
   icsql-connections`.  See the [connection](#connections) section for
   specifics on each field.
4. In Emacs: `M-x icsql` and `RET` to configure the library in `ciSQL` or give
   the customized connection provided in the previous step.


## Connections

The fields for connections with `icsql-connections` should be left blank or the
default value if there is no meaningful value.  The fields are:

* **Name**: Whatever string is meaningful to you.
* **Product**: The product of the backing JDBC connection (i.e. `mysql`,
  `oracle` etc) or leave the default for custom JDBC drivers that have no
  correlated product.  See [below](#product) for more information on product.
* **Host**: the fully qualified host name to connect to (if any)
* **Database**: The data base name, or in some cases, the file (*sqlite*
  driver) or directory (*csv* driver).
* **User**: The login user name if any.
* **Password**: The login password if any.
* **Configuration**: A list of key value pairs that set variable(s) on [ciSQL] startup.

See the documentation in [connecting to a database] to specifics on each field.

An example entry for a [PostgreSQL] follows using
`M-x customize-variable icsql-connection` follows:
```bluespec
Name: my-postgres-entry
Product: postgres
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database: mycooldb
User: joebob
Password: <some password>
```

This entry, and an example SQLite entry can be set in the `~/.emacs` file as
well:
```lisp
(setq icsql-connections
      '(("my-sqlite-entry" slite "" "" "/path/to/db.sqlite3" "" "" nil)
	("my-postgres-entry" postgres "localhost" "5432" "mycooldb" "joebob" "some password" nil)))
```



### Product

For more information on Emacs SQL products see the `sql-product-alist`
variable.  You can also get a full list of products with `M-:` and the following Lisp:
```emacs-lisp
(mapcar 'car sql-product-alist)
```


## Command Line Help

You can get command line help to the subordinate command line program [ciSQL]
using the following `icsql-help-command-line`.
